# Course site for AI in medicine

Course site: https://martinmodrak.github.io/ai-in-medicine-2025/


Site build instructions (ignore for course):

The code uses `renv` to recreate the same environment as we used to run the examples.
Run `renv::restore()` after loading the project.

The rendered site can be rebuilt with `rmarkdown::render_site()`.
