run so we'll see how things work out.

- Lesson 1 - History and principles of AI: [outline](history.html), [tasks](history-tasks.html)
- Lesson 2 - Machine learning, validation, overfitting [outline](ml_validation.html), [tasks](ml_validation-tasks.html)
- Lesson 3 - Neural networks for image analysis: [outline](images.html) (no tasks, just discussion)
- Lesson 4 - Building ChatGPT: [outline](llm1.html), [tasks](llm1-tasks.html)
- Lesson 5 - Text mining with ChatGPT: [outline](llm-mining.html), [tasks](llm-mining-tasks.html)
- Lesson 6 - Basics of "classical" image analysis: [outline](images_simple.html), [tasks](images_simple-tasks.html)
- Lesson 7 - Simple machine learning with histology slides: [outline](images_simple_ml.html), [tasks](images_simple_ml-tasks.html)


Credit will be given to anyone with at most 2 absences, who completes the final
task (described within tasks for [Lesson 7](images_simple_ml-tasks.html)).
