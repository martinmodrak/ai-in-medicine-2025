## Principles

- Definitions of AI
  - Is thermostat AI?
  - Is chess playing AI?
  - Is machine translation AI?
  - "AI is what computers cannot do."
    - Succesful solution of AI problems leads to new subfields not considered AI
- Individual algorithms
  - NPCs in games
- Search
  - Heuristics 
    - Mini task: (obscured maze, choose next step)
  - Adversarial search - minimax
    - Example: 
    - Task: Draw the game tree for tic-tac-toe starting with OOX/X O/  X... and find the optimal move (X starts). 
  - Logical Inference
    - Sudoku
- Connectionism
- Machine learning and AI
- Types of learning: Supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement 
  - Semi-supervised
- Supervised learning: Function approximation
  - Task - devise classification rules
  - Machine learning can be simple!
- Other parts of AI/AI-related
  - Evolutionary algorithms
  - Optimal control

## A look into History 

__Tato kapitola nakonec nebyla odpřednášena, jen jsme si pohráli s perceptronem__

- Overall, the Wiki for [history of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence) is a pretty good starting point
- Search and symbols (Cca 1950 - 1974)
  - 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do." H. A. Simon
  - In parallel: first neuronal “networks”
  - AI Winter
- Expert systems Cca 1980 - 1987
  - IF-THEN rules
    - Task: build an expert system for diagnosing heart attack
  - In parallel: revival of neural networks
  - Second AI Winter
- Neural networks
  - Early attempts (1943 - 60s)
    - [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) 
    - Perceptron task!
  - First revival (1980s)
    - Hebb rule, [Hopfield network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network)
    - Backpropagation
      - Biologically questionable, but see e.g. [Song et al. 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7610561/)
    - 3 layers are enough?!
- Bright future
  - Since ~1993 AI is fashionable again
   - Deep learning (~2011)
   - GPU
